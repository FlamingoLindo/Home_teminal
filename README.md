# FLAMINGO'S USELESS TERMINAL

This is a project made using python and different libraies that I'm developing for fun.

It started as me jsut trying to make my own taks manager perfomace graph thingy:![Perfomace thingy that I'm talking about](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/827008047054192720/1274459699470667807/image.png?ex=66c25496&is=66c10316&hm=695636c04ffede83c57c0232c1d7b5c2ddbd19a93004c8352e9508a3f1dc10f5&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=805&height=589)

It did no go well in the beginning since I pretty much gave up on it for a while but I came up with different functionalities for it as you will see...

And yes if you thing that somethings look like ChatGPT made it, its because it probably did, since I'm using to learn things.

* Just a silly little "loading" screen, jsut to give the impression that its accuatly loading something (but it's not)

* I got the flamingo ASCII from https://ascii.co.uk/art/flamingo

* I used [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) for the loading bar

* And for the colour text I just used [ANSI Escape Sequences](https://gist.github.com/fnky/458719343aabd01cfb17a3a4f7296797)
